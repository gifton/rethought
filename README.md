# rethought
Rethought is an application designed to help keep track of your thoughts, and continue those thoughts.  Adding entries for images, text, links,  and audio recordings (more in the works!).  Written in Swift, rethought takes advantage of a few cocoa pods, and the MVVM application structure. 


> Rethought uses MVVM, and core data to present thoughts.  Thought entities have a subentity called Entry, that can be text, an image, a link or an audio recording.
